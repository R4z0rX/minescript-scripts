# minescript-scripts

A collection of scripts I’ve created for [**Minescript**](https://github.com/maxuser0/minescript) mod, including Minescript Plus — a feature-rich API extension (actively developed) — as well as various tools and utilities, and some examples.

## Structure

* lib — Modules to provide functionality to scripts
* svc — Scripts meant to run as services, not commands
* tools — Just some tools
* The rest are commands or just experiments or examples

## Notes

All code in this repository is developed by me. When I use (or rely on) other people's code, I acknowledge proper credit in the script itself, and in its README if there is one.
